React.js, commonly referred to as React, is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) or user interface components for web applications. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React is known for its simplicity, efficiency, and the way it facilitates the development of interactive and reusable UI components.

React's simplicity and flexibility have made it a popular choice for building modern web and mobile applications. Whether you're building a small personal project or a large-scale application, React provides a powerful and efficient way to create interactive user interfaces.
